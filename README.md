# Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

This is a form of the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) that takes an arbitary crystal structure to predict material properties, to function with slab data (see: [Discovery of stable surfaces with extreme work functions by high-throughput density functional theory and machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10905)).

See the original paper for details of the CGCNN framework:
